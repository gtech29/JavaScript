# JavaScript Practice Projects

This repository contains practice projects aimed at learning fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. This projects can help me reinforce essential concepts such as working with arrays, strings, functions, loops, `if/else` statements, and methods within JavaScript.

## What I Learned

* Utilizing arrays and strings in JavaScript
* Implementing functions for modular code
* Applying loops (`for` loops) for iterative tasks
* Using conditional statements (`if/else`) for decision-making
* Exploring various JavaScript methods for string manipulation

## Project Structure

* **script.js** : JavaScript file containing the logic for generating pyramids.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `pyramidGenerator.js` in an IDE to see the Pyramid Generator in action.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of JavaScript programming concepts.
